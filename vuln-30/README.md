TEST vuln-00.attack

This is a Gauntlt test to check if the vulnerability in WebGoat located at General => Http Basics (vuln-30) exists.

It will return a

1 (error) if the vulnerability is present
0 (success) if the vulnerability is fixed (aka not present)
This test assumes 3 things:

(1) That jerry-curl and jq are installed and available on the $PATH and uses the generic command-line attack. To install these run the following command on Debian-based systems aka those using .deb packages.

$ sudo apt-get install owasp-wte-jerry-curl owasp-wte-jq
This assumes you have the OWASP WTE repo setup on the computer running Gauntlt. If not, it can be added with:

$ sudo echo "deb http://appseclive.org/apt/14.04 trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/owasp-wte.list
$ sudo wget -q -O - http://appseclive.org/apt/owasp-wte.gpg.key | apt-key add -
(2) The script ./webgoat/vuln-00/vuln-00-runner is in the path aka $PATH This can be done & confirmed with:

$ sudo cp webgoat/vuln-00/vuln-00-runner /usr/bin/
$ sudo chmod 775 /usr/bin/vuln-00-runner 
$ which vuln-00-runner
/usr/bin/vuln-00-runner
(3) There is a local proxy running on 127.0.0.1:8888

Testing vuln-00 can be done outside of Gauntlt by navigating to the webgoat/vuln-00 directory and running:

$ ./exploit-vuln-00.bash
