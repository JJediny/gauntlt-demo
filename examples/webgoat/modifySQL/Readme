TEST modifySQL.attack

This is a Gauntlt test to check if the vulnerability in WebGoat located at Injection Flaws => Modify Data with SQL Injection exists.

It will return a

- test failed if the vulnerability is present
- test successful if the vulnerability is fixed (aka not present)

This test assumes 2 things:

1) That a version of python3 is installed on the computer with compatibility for the requests library. Python3 can be installed with the following command.

$ sudo apt-get install python3

This may or may not require an update of the python pip software.

2) The script ./webgoat/modifySQL/modifySQL-runner is in the path aka $PATH This can be done and confirmed with:

$ sudo cp webgoat/modifySQL/modifySQL-runner /usr/bin/
$ sudo chmod 775 /usr/bin/modifySQL-runner 
$ which modifySQL-runner
/usr/bin/modifySQL-runner

Testing this vulnerability can be done outside of Gauntlt by navigating to the webgoat/modifySQL directory and running 

$ ./exploit-modifySQL.bash
