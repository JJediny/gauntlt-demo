Feature: hello world with gauntlt using the generic command line attack
  Scenario:
    When I launch a "generic" attack with:
      """
      python /home/hacker/gauntlt-demo/examples/webgoat/vuln-24/vuln-24-attack.py
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      Attack Failed. vuln-24 is not present
      """
