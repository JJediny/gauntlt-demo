Background:
  Given a directory named "../../" should exist
  And I cd to "../../"
  And a file named "vuln-27.py" should exist

Scenario: Verify that the HTML field restrictions cannot be bypassed
  And I launch a "generic" attack with:
    """
    python vuln-27.py
    """
  Then the output should contain:
    """
    The HTML field restrictions could not be bypassed
    """
