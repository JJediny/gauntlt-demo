Feature: Test for vuln-27, Bypass HTML Field Restrictions

Scenario: Verify that the HTML field restrictions cannot be bypassed
  And I launch a "generic" attack with:
    """
    vuln-27.py
    """
  Then the output should contain:
    """
    The HTML field restrictions could not be bypassed
    """
