# Some examples of items to put in this config file
# 
# For repeated requests to the same URL:
BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat
#    NOTE:  BASE is the only config option done as a key=value pair.
#           All others are simply one command line option per line.
#           Make sure the line starts with "BASE="
# 
# NOTE: DO NOT QUOTE ARGUMENTS TO COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
# jerry-curl will automagically quote them for you
#
# Proxy curl commands:
--proxy 127.0.0.1:8888 
# 
# Allow insecure SSL:
# --insecure
#
# Include headers in the output
