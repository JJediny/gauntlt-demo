Feature: Uploading a zipBomb with gauntlt using the python command line attack
  Scenario:
    When I launch a "generic" attack with:
      """
      python /home/hacker/gauntlt-demo/examples/webgoat/vuln-23/exploit-vuln-23.py
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      * File uploaded
      """
    Then the output should not contain:
      """
      * Congratulations
      """
