TEST Vuln-06.attack

This is a Gauntlt test to check if the vulnerability in WebGoat located at Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) => LAB: Cross-Sit Scripting => Stage 1: Stored XSS (vuln-06) exists.

It will return a

XSS Present (error) if the vulnerability is present
No XSS Present (success) if the vulnerability is fixed (aka not present)


This test assumes 3 things:

(1) The script ./webgoat/vuln-06/Vuln-06.attack and ./webgoat/vuln-06/attack.py is in the correct path

(2) There is a local proxy running on 127.0.0.1:8888

(3) WebGoat is running on 127.0.0.1:8080

Testing vuln-06 can be done outside of Gauntlt by navigating to the gauntlt-demo/XSS and running:

$ gauntlt
